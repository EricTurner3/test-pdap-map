Testing PDAP Map
===

Simple map test with Leaflet.js and GeoJSON of the US States to display current PDAP progress

* I tried with counties, but the file is 300MB+ and took too long to load for usability
* States is still kinda big but loaded withing 20s
* Clicking a state could perhaps load more in-depth county information, right now it displays a simple popup
