Testing PDAP Map
===

Simple map test with Bootstrap,  Leaflet.js and GeoJSON of the US States to display current PDAP progress

* Sidebar to display information (just displays scraper now)
* `Bug`: Awaiting issue with DoltHub to fix CORS access so we can fetch data
* NOTE: Leaflet.js, Bootstrap 5 files are in the .gitignore, only custom made files are in the repo.
